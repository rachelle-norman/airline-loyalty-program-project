# Airline Loyalty Program Project

This repo contains the locations of all of the resources related to my Airline Loyalty Program Project.

It showcases my ability to use Excel to tidy up and transform data, employ SQL for some deep dives into the data, and create dashboards in Tableau that are designed to be user-friendly, offering insights that make sense to stakeholders and answer various business questions.

The dataset I'm using for this project is from [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground).
